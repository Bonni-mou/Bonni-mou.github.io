     <h1> Before the After </h1>
     <p> Last year, same day, it was our Recognition Day. We received awards and medals that payed off our hardworks as a student. For me, it wasn't anything special. 
        What I really looked for that day is you. I was hoping to see you, greet you, congratulate you before I lose the chance to see you or even to take care of you. 
        I am happy for you, but at the same time, scared that I might lose you--even you weren't mine yet that time. But a boring day turned into something special-- 
        very special-- when you asked me a question I never thought you would ask. I never expected it because I was the one courting you and I am the one who's supposed 
        to ask you that question. Maybe you were wondering why am I taking things too slow or what took me so long to ask you to be my girlfriend. You might know by now, 
        or not, but I have reasons I wanted to consider at that time. I want to feel the comfort, openness, and love between us first. Even though I felt that we're 
        getting there, it wasn't enough yet to make such decision to get to the next stage. But who am I to reject you--the most beautiful woman I have been dreaming 
        for months. The moment I have always been waiting for-- for us to be officially couple who loves just each other-- is finally being brought up by my dream love. 
        However, I do not want to accept your offer, but I want you to accept mine instead. I don't want to miss that opportunity, I won't consider my reasons anymore. I will
        just do everything to get your trust, love and comfort. I will court you still and work hard for your love I hope I'm worthy of. That day, no awards nor medals could 
        ever make me feel such happiness the way you do. You were, and you are still the greatest achievement I ever have in my life that I will always be proud of. I am 
        willing to shout my love for you to the whole world, as long as you stand by me for the rest of our lives.</p>
